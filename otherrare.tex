\section{Other rare decays}

%While the core physics program of the LHCb experiment includes as a strong part the study of all 
%$b$ and $c$- hadrons rare decays, owing to the very low transverse momenta involved, in some cases
%ATLAS and CMS experiments can give only limited contributions. 

In this section we describe a set of studies which are important for their NP sensitivity 
but whose results are almost exclusively from LHCb. 
We do not go into the detail of the measurements but give only a brief review of them.
