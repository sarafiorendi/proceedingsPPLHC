\subsection{Radiative decays}

Rare radiative b-hadrons decays probing the FCNC $b\to s \gamma$ transition are complementary 
to $b\to s \ell \ell $ processes and are particularly sensitive to the $C_7$ Wilson coefficient. 

The LHCb core physics program includes also radiative $b$-hadron decays. 
In particular the LHCb experiment has obtained the first observation of the photon polarisation ~\cite{Aaij:2014wgo} in $b\to s \gamma$
transitions through the study of $B^+ \to K^+ \pi^+ \pi^-\gamma$ decays. 
Furtheremore  the ratio of branching fractions of the $B^0\to K^{\ast 0} \gamma$ and $B^0_s\to \phi \gamma$ decays has been measured
together with a search for direct CP asymmetry of the $B^0\to K^{\ast 0}\gamma$ decay~\cite{Aaij:2012ita}.
These measurements are only the start of a long program of measuremens of which a notable example will be 
the measurement of the effective lifetime of the $B^0_s \to \phi\gamma$ decay, which is strongly sensitive to new physics. 

The study of radiative $b$-hadron decays at ATLAS and CMS is difficult due to the low efficiency of reconstructing very low $p_T$ photons,
either directly or as $e^+e^-$ pairs. Therefore at present it is not foreseen a contribution of these two experiments in this field.
